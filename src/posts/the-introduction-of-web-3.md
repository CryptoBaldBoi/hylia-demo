The internet you see today is much more centralized now than it was 10 years and 20 years ago. Couple of monolithic corporations control large numbers of the activities online, which includes our security details and even personal data and activities.

Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and teach giant like Google, are regularly at the center of data privacy scandals and accusations of unethical behavior. But even if we overlook that, their entire model is still built on prioritizing their own profit margins over the user experience. They still control the activities of these platforms. They take down your posts, tweets and even your account without your notice and there’s nothing you can do about it. They own your posts, tweets and photos you upload on their platforms and give their users little credit which is not enough. Users don’t get the owners right but these platforms own all the right.
