> *Have you ever asked yourself what is web3 or how the word web3 come to existence? If you have ever asked yourself these questions then, the answer you’re seeking for is here.*

The internet you see today is much more centralized now than it was 10 years and 20 years ago. Couple of monolithic corporations control large numbers of the activities online, which includes our security details and even personal data and activities.

Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and tech giant like Google, are regularly at the center of data privacy scandals and accusations of unethical behavior. But even if we overlook that, their entire model is still built on prioritizing their own profit margins over the user experience. They still control the activities of these platforms. They take down your posts, tweets and even your account without your notice and there’s nothing you can do about it. They own your posts, tweets and photos you upload on their platforms and give their users little credit which is not enough. Users don’t get the owners right but these platforms own all the right.

## **The origin of internet.**

<!--StartFragment-->

Before we dive into web3, let’s go back in history how the internet was originated. Let’s take a quick look at the history of the internet.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The origin of the Internet was traced back in the 1970s by the US government to protect it nuclear weapons from hacking. Us government figured out if a single computer controlled all the rockets in peak Cold War would cause a big disaster. So they built a decentralized network of multiple computers instead. Which mean the US could keep its part of the “mutually assured destruction” bargain even in case of a Soviet cyberattack.

### Web-1

<!--StartFragment-->

Web1 was designed as a “hyperlinked information system.” A giant library of data sourced together on a screen from computers all across the network for users to browse by clicking around linked text and images. In 1990, the Internet was a bunch of connected computers, created by Tim Berners-Lee and the web was its first application. It’s a content delivery network that enables the showcase of the piece of information on the websites.

Mass adoption came five years later with the introduction of browsers like Mosaic and Microsoft Internet Explorer. In its early days, the web was a niche tool, used almost exclusively by academics. These were the good old surfing days. You’d dial in. Downloading a picture took years. Altavista was the default search engine. Nobody had thought of web design yet.

**How  web-1 was designed**

<!--StartFragment-->

* Decentralized- Powered by regular computers from regular users.
* Open-source- Anyone could build on the web.
* Read-only- Publishing content required some technical skills, so most users were readers.

Web= decentralized infrastructure symbolized its original ethos. Anyone could publish information of any kind, to anyone in the world, without the permission of central gatekeepers.

### Web-2

<!--StartFragment-->

Fast-forward 10 years, the Wild West had grouped around winners like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, pulling in huge numbers of users and talent black-hole style. For the first time, anyone could publish online. As barriers faded, users and usage surged. The Internet had something for everyone.

<!--StartFragment-->

In the backend, three big shifts shaped web2 as we know it today:

**Mobile:** Smartphones move us from a few hours per day at our desktops to “always connected”. Apps and notifications rule our lives.

**Social:** Instagram, Twitter and Facebook get us to show our faces and emerge from anonymity. They make it easy to create, share, interact and recommend. We go from sharing photos with friends to getting into knowing strangers.

**Cloud:** Amazon, Google and Microsoft make it cheap to build on the web. Instead of having to buy and maintain expensive hardware infrastructure, you can now rent it low-cost from vast data centers around the world.



The internet have become centralized. It’s essentially a bunch of closed systems interacting with each other.

Now you know the difference between web-1 and web-2. In web-1 it a bunch of open systems interacting with each other, while in web2 it bunch of closed systems interacting with each other. As we suddenly gained access to more people, ideas and technologies than our brains knew what to do with, the central platforms blew up like mushroom clouds, consolidating network effects into monopoly power.

<!--StartFragment-->

Networks become exponentially more valuable as they gain more users. You join Whatsapp to talk to your friends. Mom joins Whatsapp to talk to you. Dad joins Whatsapp to talk to mom. Before you know it, the whole world uses Whatsapp. You can’t leave.

<!--StartFragment-->

In February 2021, WhatsApp changed its privacy rules in a take it or leave it announcement: It would harvest more user data for profit. Millions swore they would ditch the app for more private alternatives, including yours truly. Not enough to escape the network’s gravitational pull, it turns out. While many chat on Signal and Telegram these days, few managed to get off WhatsApp completely. You still want to talk to Mom and Mom still wants to talk to Dad.

In this digital era, customer value is a direct function of network size. Users can’t leave, Startups can’t compete, Media, developers and creators have no choice but to play along. The network pull is too strong so we become addicted to social media platforms. We pay the price not in dollars but in personal data and contents. To be mined, sold and fed back into secret algorithms that hijack our attention so we’d give more. All under the veil of “free” and “improving user experience.”  

Yourself expression is their market cap.



Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon (GAFA) control our conversations, searches, contents, media and data. The open forum has become a walled garden. Today’s Internet is an oligarchy.



#### Why it fail:

1. **Attention in the economy:** Attention became the Internet’s native currency. Sites compete for it with algorithmically generated content loops you can’t stop scrolling and headlines you can’t stop clicking. Starting out, the web didn’t have a way for exchanging value. People were not keen on pulling out credit cards online. So the default business model started to attract users with free stuff and sell access to their eyeballs e.g advertising.
2. **Seeking attention:** The business of media has always been to keep you watching. To actually inform might get you to tune out and take action in the physical world. But watching TV we are at least synced within the same self-perpetuating loop of opinions.
3. **Personalized:** In web2, we are each fed a personalized diet of whatever triggers us most. Different opinions have become different facts. And as your alternative reality clashes with mine, Facebook’s stock price goes up. The bigger the fire, the higher the profits. Social media brings the world together to tear it apart. Because it’s good for business. When clicks equal revenue, there is no incentive to tell the truth. The result is clickbait, misinformation, fake news, ad blockers, and ad blocker-blockers.
4. **Internet is owned:** In web2 the platforms own everything you post online, that includes the profile data you fill out, the behavioral data you generate, and the images, videos, songs, status updates and comments you upload. Whatever you do on platform turf is platform property. Anything you upload online is owned by the platform, the file is copied onto it server and ownership is passed to the company. It becomes the raw material algorithms mine to generate the attention advertisers pull out their wallets for. You sow, the platform reaps. There are returns for you too, to be sure. We wouldn’t play ball if there weren’t. Sharing content online builds reputation, audiences and connections. The kind of social capital that can be monetized in its own right. Artists and creators never had such instant access to so many potential fans.
5. **Censorship & profile disabled:** Social media platforms block profile of their users without issuing any kind of warning or proper investigations. When Twitter and Facebook banned Donald Trump, he told his supporters to follow him to Parler. Next thing Apple and Google removed Parler’s mobile app from their app stores, Where upon Amazon delivered the final blow by kicking Parler’s website from its hosting servers. Trump became digitally homeless. Close to 90% of the web is stored with four hosting providers, the biggest of which is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Their data center run the sites and apps we use everyday e.g Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, Uber, Reddit, Netflix and so on. We access them through browsers (web) and download them from app stores (mobile).These companies control the gates to the global marketplace of ideas. You play by their rules or don’t play at all. They ban your accounts, your apps, your websites. Even when you did not break their rules, you can still be guilty of living in the wrong place. Censorship is easy when all it takes is blocking a handful central servers, as governments know all too well. Take China’s Great Firewall: as effective at keeping state secrets as at keeping Facebook, Twitter, Google and Wikipedia from its citizens, the Nigerian government banned Twitter in Nigeria because Jack banned the Twitter account of the Nigeria president (president Muhammadu Buhari) for breaking their rules.
6. **Hacker Kingdom:** The internet became home for hackers to live in, feed on and do whatever they want to do. Billions of devices uploading their data to a handful of giant data centers is like a central bank with infinite doors to break in. It means I could steal your bank credentials by hacking my neighbour’s smart fridge. It means Russian cyber terrorists can freeze ATMs, shut down railroads and lock down hospitals in Ukraine by taking control of the server. Today’s web is a chilling case of the maxim that a system can only ever be as secure as its weakest link. The crucial flaw is that the weakest link can’t be fixed because new links are added every day. By design, the solution can never match the scale of the problem, and as commerce becomes ever more peer-to-peer and device-to-device, the problem is bound to snowball into systemic bankruptcy.

How can we keep records that are objective and immune to human bias? The answer is the blockchain technology. Remove humans from the equation altogether.
